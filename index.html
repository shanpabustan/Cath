                    <span>
                        &emsp; I hope this letter brings a smile to your face and eases a bit of your stress while you read it. First of all, Happy 21st Birthday!. I’m wishing you nothing but the best today and always. I’m really grateful I got the chance to know you—even if we just met online. It all started with your missing iPhone and those photocards (hehe), but look at us now. Things feel different in a good way.I know we have our share of misunderstandings, and I admit I have my faults too. That’s why I always end up writing apology letters (haha). I’m sorry if I was busy during Holy Week and we didn’t get to talk like we usually do. I’m also sorry if it ever felt like you didn’t want to talk to me—I guess I just overthink sometimes.

                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Anyway, enjoy your special day! I know you have duty later, but don’t forget to pause, pray, and wear that beautiful smile of yours. And as I promised, I won’t get tired of writing letters for you—or of being here for you, no matter what. Once again, Happy Birthday, Cath!
